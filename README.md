# GAE-Static: Hosting on Google Cloud Made Simple


## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice ⚠️
Google Cloud has deprecated the App Engine Launcher utility that made this boiler plate easy to use for non developers. While the [app.yaml](https://github.com/blainegarrett/gae-static/blob/master/app.yaml) file is still applicable for static file hosting, there are probably better solutions such as [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
